This project is deconstructing an existing webpage and rebuilding it to learn how elements are placed on a page and how they get styled and aligned. At the end of this project I will be able to:
1. Use at least two ways to move a div around on the page.
2. Stick a div onto the top or bottom of a page.
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage.
4. Grab the URL for an image from an exisiting webpage.
5. Center an element horiziontally. 
6. Identify three ways to include CSS styles in a page.
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on a page.
8. Build a very basic form (regardless of it's destination.)
